# Umlaut converter

This is a little utility thingy I use to clean my .mp3/flac/etc. media files from umlauts (ä's and ä's) before transferring them to my digital audio player, which, unfortunately, does not support such characters.

## Usage

Provide the media directory as an argument:

```bash
<exec> /path/to/the/media
```
